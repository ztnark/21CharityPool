#21CharityPool

A quick application for pooling and donating micro-donations to charities. Currently only supports BitGive.

Donations are collected and stored off-chain until the balance exceeds 20,000, then flushed to the blockchain. Donations are then made to the specified charities after the confirmed on-chain balance exceeds 100,000 Satoshi.

Please feel free to suggest additional charities, and pull requests are welcome!
